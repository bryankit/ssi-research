Hyperledger Aries provides a shared,  reusable,  interoperable tool kit designed for initiatives and
solutions  focused   on creating,  transmitting and  storing verifiable  digital credentials.  It is
infrastructure   for  blockchain-rooted,  peer-to-peer  interactions.   This  project  consumes  the
cryptographic support provided  by  Hyperledger  Ursa,  to  provide  secure  secret  management  and
decentralized key management functionality.
