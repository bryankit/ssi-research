# EDX Course: Intro to Hyperledger Sovereign Identity Solutions: Indy, Aries, & Ursa

To the surprise of absolutely no one, trust is broken on the Internet.  Wherever you go online,  the
advice is the same—make sure you understand what’s behind each button before you click it.

In this course, we’ll dive into three Hyperledger open source projects—Indy, Aries and  Ursa—looking
at the tools, libraries,  and  reusable components they provide for  creating and using  independent
digital identities rooted  on  blockchains  or  other  distributed  ledgers.  We  will  explore  the
possibilities  they  offer  for  building  applications  on  a solid digital foundation of trust and
examine how these technologies can make the Internet safe. It’s quite a challenge!


## What will you learn

Hyperledger Indy, Aries and Ursa are blockchain-based  frameworks that enable  an  important missing
layer of the Internet—the trust layer.  While still rooted  in blockchain  technology,  the  use  of
blockchain in these projects is quite different from the other Hyperledger projects, such as  Fabric
or Sawtooth. Where the other projects are general purpose blockchain systems (they can  be  used  in
many situations), Indy, Aries and Ursa are used for a specific purpose—and it’s big! They are  about
identity on the Internet and being able to trust the data passed to you. They are about  being  able
to prove to others who you are and you being certain who they are.


## Gabriel's Notes

### Indy, Aries, and Ursa

In great essense, Indy,  Aries,  and Ursa is created to serve as  trust  layer to the internet using
mechanisms that are easy to use, enable online trust and enhance privacy. It's a big goal that is of
vital importance to everyone on the internet.  And it's  a  goal that has recently become realizable
with the advent of blockchain.
