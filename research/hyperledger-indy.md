# HyperLedger Indy

## From the [Website](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/hyperledger-indy)

**Type: Distributed Ledger Software**

Hyperledger Indy provides tools, libraries, and reusable components for providing digital identities
rooted  on  blockchains  or  other  distributed  ledgers  so  that  they  are  interoperable  across
administrative domains,  applications,  and  any  other  silo.  Indy  is  interoperable  with  other
blockchains or can be used standalone powering the decentralization of identity.
