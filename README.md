# Gabriel's Public SSI Research 
SSI Stands for Self Sovereign Identity. I do believe that this would be the futuristic way
of logging in. SSI is decentralization of one's identity, reducing ID silos and shall
improve privacy.

I am still learning this technology, and I am going to use this repository to develop
experimental projects that proves this concept.
